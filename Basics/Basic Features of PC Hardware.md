# Basic features of PC Hardware 
The primary internal components of a personal computer (PC) include the processor, memory, and registers. 
Registers are elements within the processor that store data and addresses. When a program is executed, it is copied from an external 
device into the internal memory. The processor then proceeds to execute the instructions of the program.

In computing, the basic unit of storage is a bit, which can hold a value of either ON (1) or OFF (0). Typically, 
a group of 8 bits forms a byte on modern computers.

To ensure the integrity of data, a parity bit is utilized to make the total number of bits in a byte odd. 
If the parity is even, the system assumes that a parity error has occurred, which could be due to hardware malfunctions or electrical disturbances, although such errors are rare.

The processor supports various data sizes, including:

- Word: a data item consisting of 2 bytes.
- Doubleword: a data item of 4 bytes (32 bits).
- Quadword: a data item of 8 bytes (64 bits).
- Paragraph: an area of 16 bytes (128 bits).
- Kilobyte: 1024 bytes.
- Megabyte: 1,048,576 bytes.
