# Assembly basics
## This is a brief introduction to assembly in general sense
Assembly is a low-level programming language that bridges the gap between high-level programming languages and the hardware of a 
computer system. It uses symbolic instructions and memory addresses to manipulate the underlying hardware directly. 
Assembly code is translated into machine code and provides precise control over the computer's operations, 
making it suitable for tasks that require performance optimization or low-level hardware interaction.
